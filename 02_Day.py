# Declare a first name variable and assign a value to it
# Declare a last name variable and assign a value to it
# Declare a full name variable and assign a value to it
# Declare a country variable and assign a value to it
# Declare a city variable and assign a value to it
# Declare an age variable and assign a value to it
# Declare a year variable and assign a value to it
# Declare multiple variable on one line
first_name, last_name, full_name, country, city, age, year = 'Chanchito', 'Feliz', 'Chanchito Feliz', 'Neverland','CC_City', 999,2023
# Exercises: Level 2
# Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
import math
print(type(country))
print(type(age))
print(type(year))
# Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
print(len(full_name))
# Compare the length of your first name and your last name
print(len(first_name)-len(last_name))
# Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
num_one, num_two=4,5
# Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
floor_divison = 4//5 
# The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
radius= 30
# Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
area_of_circle = math.pi * radius**2
# Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
circum_of_circle = math.pi * (radius*2)
print(help('keywords'))
